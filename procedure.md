### Procedure

#### Fourier Series Coefficients

This section requires selection of a signal, and visualizing its first 20 fourier series coefficients. Click on the "**Check**" button to visualize the plots. Steps to be done are as follows

1. Choose a signal from the drop-down menu
2. Click the "Plot" button to view the plot in the figures

The plots are generated showing the ak, bk and original signal plots in the observation panel.

#### Square series coefficients

This section requires selection of a signal, and visualizing its first 20 square series coefficients. Click on the "**Check**" button to visualize the plots. Steps to be done are as follows

1. Choose a signal from the drop-down menu
2. Click the "Plot" button to view the plot in the figures

The plots are generated showing the ak, bk and original signal plots in the observation panel.

#### Fourier series reconstruction

This section requires selection of a signal, and sliding the slider to choose the number of fourier series coefficients for reconstructing the original signal and visualizing its effect in the plot. Click on the "**Check**" button to visualize the plot. Steps to be done are as follows

1. Choose a signal from the drop-down menu
2. Click the "Plot" button to view the plot in the figures
3. Slide the slider to change the number of coefficients for reconstruction

The plot is live-generated showing the reconstructed and original signals in the observation panel.

#### Square series reconstruction

This section requires selection of a signal, and sliding the slider to choose the number of square series coefficients for reconstructing the original signal and visualizing its effect in the plot. Click on the "**Check**" button to visualize the plot. Steps to be done are as follows

1. Choose a signal from the drop-down menu
2. Click the "Plot" button to view the plot in the figures
3. Slide the slider to change the number of coefficients for reconstruction

The plot is live-generated showing the reconstructed and original signals in the observation panel.

#### Quasi-Periodic

This section requires selection of a real-life system, and visualizing the quasi-periodic signal associated with it in the plot. Click on the "**Check**" button to visualize the plot. Steps to be done are as follows

1. Choose a real-life system from the drop-down list
2. Click the "Plot" button to view the plot in the figure

The plot is generated showing the quasi-periodic signal associated with the selected real-life system.
